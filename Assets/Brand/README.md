## 🎯 Logo: "X Marks the Spot"

**File Location**: `Logos/`

The X logo represents the universal treasure-hunting symbol "X marks the spot." This is NOT pirate-specific - treasure maps and X markings are common to:
- Wild West gold prospecting
- General treasure hunting
- Adventure games

**Usage**:
- App icon
- Loading screens
- Marketing materials
- Watermarks

## 🤠 Mascot: Black Bart (BB)

**File Location**: `Mascot/`

We have two visual styles for the BB mascot:

### Realistic Style
- Distinguished older gentleman
- Cowboy hat
- Gray/white hair and mustache
- Piercing blue eyes (matches historical description)
- Steampunk elements: holographic collar, Tesla-tech accents
- Chrono-Compass on chain around neck
- **Use for**: Marketing, promotional materials, website

### Animated/3D Style  
- Stylized cartoon character
- Bowler hat with clock goggles
- Gray beard
- Duster coat
- Compass medallion
- Fire/energy effects (time-travel powers)
- **Use for**: In-app UI, game HUD, tutorials, notifications

## 🎨 Design Notes

Both mascot styles incorporate:

1. **Wild West Elements**: Hat, coat, Western attire
2. **Steampunk Elements**: Gears, clocks, brass, Tesla-inspired tech
3. **The Chrono-Compass**: Always visible as key story element
4. **Distinguished Gentleman**: Matches historical "polite, intellectual" descriptions
5. **Warm, Approachable**: BB is friendly, not menacing

**Remember**: Black Bart was a Wild West stagecoach robber, NOT a pirate. See `Docs/brand-guide.md` for full character details.
