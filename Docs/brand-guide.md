## ⚠️ Critical Clarification: NOT A PIRATE!

**Black Bart was NOT a pirate.** He was a **Wild West stagecoach robber** - a land-based outlaw from the California Gold Rush era. He had nothing to do with:

| ❌ NOT Black Bart | ✅ IS Black Bart |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Pirate ships | Stagecoaches |
| Ocean/sea | Dusty trails |
| "Ahoy matey" | Western drawl |
| Treasure islands | Gold Rush mining towns |
| Skull and crossbones | Gold coins and strongboxes |
| Tricorn hat & eyepatch | Bowler hat & flour-sack mask |
| Walking the plank | "Throw down the box!" |
| Parrots | Poems left at crime scenes |

**When writing UI text, dialogue, or any content - use Wild West terminology, NOT pirate terminology.**

## 📜 The Historical Black Bart

### Who He Really Was

**Charles E. Boles** (c. 1829 – disappeared February 28, 1888), known as **Black Bart**, was an English-born American outlaw.

**Key Historical Facts:**

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Born** | c. 1829, Norfolk, England |
| **Died/Disappeared** | After February 28, 1888 (the mystery that inspires our story) |
| **Real Name** | Charles E. Boles (also Charles Bolton, C.E. Bolton) |
| **Occupation** | Stagecoach robber, prospector, Civil War soldier |
| **Robberies** | 28 Wells Fargo stagecoaches (1875-1883) |
| **Signature** | Left poems at crime scenes, signed "Black Bart the Po8" |
| **Trademark Look** | Flour sack mask with eye holes, linen duster coat, bowler hat |
| **Weapon** | Brandished shotgun but **never fired it** |
| **Unique Trait** | Afraid of horses - fled all robberies **on foot** |
| **Capture** | Caught via laundry-marked handkerchief (F.X.O.7) traced to San Francisco |
| **Prison** | San Quentin, ~4 years, released January 1888 |
| **Final Fate** | Vanished February 1888 - never seen again |

### His Character

The police report described Boles as:

> *"A person of great endurance. Exhibited genuine wit under most trying circumstances, and was extremely proper and polite in behavior. **Eschews profanity.**"*

A 14-year-old witness (Donna McCreary) described him:

> *"Graying brown hair, missing two of his front teeth, deep-set piercing blue eyes under heavy eyebrows. Slender hands and **intellectual in conversation, well-flavored with polite jokes.**"*

### His Famous Poems

**First Poem** (August 3, 1877):
```
I've labored long and hard for bread,
For honor, and for riches,
But on my corns too long you've tread,
You fine-haired sons of bitches.

— Black Bart, 1877
```

**Second Poem** (July 25, 1878):
```
Here I lay me down to sleep
To wait the coming morrow,
Perhaps success, perhaps defeat,
And everlasting sorrow.
Let come what will, I'll try it on,
My condition can't be worse;
And if there's money in that box
'Tis munny in my purse.

— Black Bart
```

Note: The gentleman who "eschews profanity" only used it in his poems - a charming contradiction!

### Why Wells Fargo?

In a letter to his wife (August 1871), Boles described an "unpleasant encounter" with Wells Fargo agents and **vowed to exact revenge**. This personal grudge drove his outlaw career.

## 🎭 Our Black Bart (BB) - The Mascot

### The Creative Transformation

We transform the historical mystery of his 1888 disappearance into a time-travel adventure.

**The Inciting Incident**: During his final 1883 robbery at Funk Hill, BB steals a prototype device from the stagecoach - the **Aetheric Resonator** (later called the **Chrono-Compass**), accidentally invented by Nikola Tesla. When activated during his escape, it propels BB through time.

### BB's Character Traits

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Happy & Excited** | Joyful adventurer, loves discovery |
| **Polite** | Gentleman manners, never crude |
| **Witty** | Intellectual humor, playful jokes |
| **Poetic** | Drops verses and riddles as clues |
| **Western Drawl** | Old West speech patterns |
| **Kind-Hearted** | Robin Hood mentality - spreads wealth |
| **Curious** | Fascinated by modern technology |

### BB's Voice Examples

**Good (Wild West):**
- "Throw down that phone and grab yer boots, partner!"
- "Well I'll be... this here contraption's mightier than a six-shooter!"
- "Reckon you've earned yerself some gold, friend."
- "That treasure ain't gonna find itself!"

**Bad (Pirate - DO NOT USE):**
- ~~"Ahoy, matey!"~~
- ~~"Shiver me timbers!"~~
- ~~"Walk the plank!"~~
- ~~"Arr, ye scurvy dog!"~~

### Time Travel Mechanics

- **Chrono-Compass**: Tesla's pocket-watch-like device with glowing dials
- **Anchors**: BBG treasures hidden across time serve as temporal anchors
- **"Stuck" in 2025**: BB is currently trapped in the present (mystery why - possibly love for Eliza Thorne, possibly device malfunction)
- **The Shadow Collective**: Tesla's group pursuing BB across timelines

### Key Characters

| Character | Role | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **BB (Black Bart)** | Protagonist/Mascot | Time-traveling gentleman bandit |
| **Nikola Tesla** | Antagonist/Founder | Formed Shadow Collective to retrieve device |
| **Eliza Thorne** | Love Interest | 2025 archaeologist/app developer |
| **Dr. Elias Voss** | Rival | Tesla's apprentice, hunts BB for power |
