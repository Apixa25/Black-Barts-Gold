## 💡 Core Concept: Two Coin Types

There are **two fundamentally different ways to hide coins**:

### 🎯 Type 1: Fixed Value Coins
- Value set at hiding time
- Finder gets exact amount
- Creates urgency and races
- Must be >$1 to raise finding limits
- **Who can use**: System, Users, Sponsors

### 🎰 Type 2: Pool Contribution Coins (Slot Machine)
- Hider contributes X amount to company pool
- Value determined at collection time
- Finder can get MORE or LESS than contribution
- Like real slots - house sometimes loses individual spins
- **Who can use**: System, Users, Sponsors

---

## 🎰 Slot Machine Economics

### How It Works
```
User contributes $10 to pool (slot machine coin)
     ↓
$10 goes to company prize pool
     ↓
Finder collects coin
     ↓
Algorithm determines payout: Could be $2... or $50!
```

### Why Company Can Afford Big Payouts
- Gas fees drain ALL accounts constantly
- 10% guaranteed profit margin on all deposits
- Individual big wins are offset by many small payouts
- Just like a casino: house always wins long-term

### Payout Factors
1. Finder's recent history (last 10 coins)
2. Finder's lifetime stats
3. Pool balance / company margin
4. Randomness for excitement

### Example Scenarios
```
Finder A: Last 3 finds = $10, $8, $5 (hot streak)
  → Finds slot coin → Gets 50¢ (cool down)

Finder B: Last 5 finds = 25¢, 10¢, 50¢, 10¢, 25¢ (cold)
  → Finds SAME slot coin → Gets $8 (reward!)

Finder C: Brand new player (first week)
  → Finds slot coin → Higher variance, exciting payouts to hook them
```

## 🔓 Finding Limits with Two Coin Types

### The Rule
**Your limit = highest amount YOU contributed (not what finder received)**

| Action | Your Limit Becomes |
|--------|-------------------|
| Hide $10 fixed coin | $10 |
| Contribute $10 to pool (slot) | $10 |
| Hide $100 fixed coin | $100 |
| Contribute $100 to pool (slot) | $100 |

### Example
```
User A hides $10 as pool contribution (slot machine)
  → User A's finding limit: $10 ✓
  → $10 goes to company pool

User B finds that coin
  → Algorithm pays User B: $3 (or $15, whatever)
  → User B's finding limit: UNCHANGED (they didn't hide anything)
```

## 👁️ Visual Distinction

Coins MUST look different in AR so players know what they're chasing:

| Coin Type | Visual Style |
|-----------|--------------|
| Fixed Value | [Design TBD - distinct look] |
| Pool/Slot Machine | [Design TBD - mystery look] |

This lets players:
- Choose to race for known fixed-value coins
- Try their luck on mystery slot coins
- Make strategic decisions about which to pursue

## 🏦 The Communal Pool

│  Constantly refilled as users pay $10                       │
│  Distributed to grids with active users                     │

## 📊 Distribution Rules

### Grid Coin Count
| Active Users in Grid | Coins Maintained |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 0 users | 0 coins (recycled after 24h) |
| 1+ users | 3 coins minimum |

### Reseeding
- When a coin is found, grid is immediately reseeded
- Target: Always 3 coins per active grid
- Multiple users in same grid see the same 3 coins

## 🎰 Dynamic Valuation (The Brilliant Part)

**System-placed coins have NO value until collected.**

When a user collects a system coin, the value is calculated based on:

### Factors
1. User's recent find history (last 10 coins)
2. User's total lifetime finds
3. Company profit margin requirements
4. Randomness for excitement

### Balancing Algorithm (Concept)

```
IF user's last 3 finds were high value ($5+):
    → Next coin: 25¢ to $1 range (cool down)

IF user's last 5 finds were low value (<$1):
    → Next coin: $2 to $5 range (reward)

IF user is new (first week):
    → Higher variance, exciting finds early

IF user is grinding heavily:
    → Diminishing returns to protect company
```

### Two Users, Same Coin, Different Values

```
User A: Last 3 finds = $10, $8, $5
        → Finds coin → Gets 50¢

User B: Last 3 finds = 25¢, 10¢, 50¢
        → Finds SAME coin → Gets $3

Both users see the same coin marker.
First to collect gets their personalized value.
```

## 💰 Revenue Protection

### The 10% Guarantee
- User pays $10
- $1 is immediate profit (gas fee structure)
- $9 goes to coin pool for distribution
- Company always makes 10% minimum

### Payout Limits
- System must track total payouts vs total deposits
- If payouts approach deposits, reduce coin values
- Heavy grinders get diminishing returns
- Casual players get better ratios (keeps them engaged)

---

## ⏱️ Timing Rules

### Initial Distribution
1. User pays $10
2. Immediately: 3 coins placed within 1 mile
3. As they find: Pool releases more to their area
4. Average location tracked to determine "home area"

### The Denver Airport Problem (Solved)
```
User signs up at Denver Airport
     ↓
3 coins placed nearby
     ↓
User boards plane, flies to San Francisco
     ↓
After 2 hours with no players at Denver Airport:
  → Coins recycle to pool
     ↓
User arrives in San Francisco, opens app
     ↓
3 coins placed in their new grid
```

### Recycling Timeline
| Condition | Coins Recycle After |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Grid has 0 active users | 24 hours |
| Grid has 0 users nearby | 2 hours (faster recycle) |
| Coin not found, users present | Never (stays available) |

---

## 🎯 User Experience Goals

### For Grinders
- Can find $10, $20, $50+ per day if dedicated
- But returns diminish to protect company
- Encouraged to hide coins to increase limits

### For Casuals
- Always 3 coins nearby
- Feel the game is populated and active
- Steady, predictable experience

### For New Users
- Exciting first finds (hook them)
- Tutorial coin experience
- Quick wins to understand mechanics

## 🔢 Complete Coin Type Matrix

| Who Hides | Fixed Value | Pool/Slot Machine |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **System** | ✅ Can place fixed coins | ✅ Primary method |
| **User** | ✅ "I'm hiding exactly $10" | ✅ "I'm contributing $10 to the pool" |
| **Sponsor** | ✅ Branded fixed-value coins | ✅ Branded mystery coins |

### When to Use Each

**Fixed Value Coins**:
- Create urgency and races
- High-dollar "mythical" coins
- Sponsor promotions with known prizes
- Users raising their finding limits

**Pool/Slot Machine Coins**:
- Keep game constantly populated
- Create excitement and mystery
- Occasional big wins to create buzz
- System's primary distribution method

---

## 📈 Denomination Variety

System ensures users don't only find one denomination:

### Tracking
- Last 10 finds recorded per user
- Denomination distribution calculated
- If too skewed, next coin corrects

### Example Correction
```
User found: 10¢, 10¢, 25¢, 10¢, 10¢, 25¢, 10¢, 10¢, 10¢, 25¢
           (90% low value)

System: "Time for a $2-5 coin to keep it exciting"
```
