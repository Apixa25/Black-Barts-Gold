# 🤠 Black Bart's Gold - Project Vision

## Executive Summary

Black Bart's Gold is an augmented reality mobile game where players hunt for virtual gold coins in the real world. Players use their phone's camera to see and collect 3D coins placed in their physical environment, with the collected coins having real cryptocurrency value.

**Built with Unity + AR Foundation** for production-quality AR that can scale to millions of users.

## 🎯 The Vision

### The Hook
"What if you could walk around your neighborhood and find real money just lying on the ground?"

### The Experience
1. **Open the app** → See a pirate-themed interface
2. **Start hunting** → AR camera activates with HUD overlay
3. **Explore** → Walk around your real environment
4. **Discover** → Virtual gold doubloons appear through your camera
5. **Collect** → Get within range, center crosshairs, tap to collect
6. **Celebrate** → Coin flies to screen, Black Bart congratulates you
7. **Profit** → Real BBG (Black Bart's Gold) added to your wallet

### What Makes It Special
- **Real Value**: Coins convert to Bitcoin, not just points
- **Physical Activity**: Must walk to find treasure
- **Social Competition**: Leaderboards, friends, guilds
- **Fair Economy**: Hide coins to unlock finding bigger ones

## 🎮 Core Game Systems

### 1. AR Treasure Hunt
```
Player Position (GPS) ──► AR Scene ──► Coins at relative positions
        │                    │                    │
        ▼                    ▼                    ▼
   Real World         Camera View          3D Gold Doubloons
```

- Coins spawn at real GPS coordinates
- AR converts GPS to 3D positions relative to player
- Coins visible through device camera
- Must physically walk to collect

### 2. Economy System

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    $10 Purchase                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  $9 → Distributed as coins near player              │
│  $1 → Gas fee (our revenue)                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Daily: ~$0.33 consumed from gas tank               │
│  No gas = Can't play                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Find Limit System

```
Your Find Limit = Highest coin you've ever hidden

┌────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────────┐
│ Hidden     │ Can Find    │ Tier             │
├────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Nothing    │ Up to $1    │ Cabin Boy        │
│ $5 coin    │ Up to $5    │ Deck Hand        │
│ $25 coin   │ Up to $25   │ Captain          │
│ $100 coin  │ Up to $100  │ King of Pirates  │
└────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────┘

Coins above your limit appear LOCKED (red, can't collect)
```

## 🔄 Migration from React Native

### What We Learned
1. **ViroReact limitations**: Not production-ready for complex apps
2. **Architecture matters**: New arch (Fabric) broke libraries
3. **Community support**: Small community = slow bug fixes
4. **Choose proven tech**: Unity has decade of AR games

### What We're Keeping
- All game design documents
- Economy mechanics
- UI/UX concepts
- Backend API design

### What's New
- Unity engine (C#)
- AR Foundation framework
- Native platform builds
- Unity-specific patterns

## 👥 Team & Collaboration

### Collaboration Profile (How to Work With Me)

- I want high-energy collaboration with practical momentum and clear progress updates.
- I respond best to long-form, plain-language explanations that make the "why" obvious.
- Include file paths in code blocks and simplified snippets so changes are easy to review.
- Ask before guessing when requirements are unclear, and verify context from the real codebase.
- I want practical, best-judgment implementation decisions. Canonical operational policy: `.cursor/rules/proactive-support-defaults.mdc`.
- Keep communication upbeat and engaging with emojis where useful. 🤠

### AI Assistant Guidelines

When working on this project:

1. **Always read first**: Start sessions by reading this file and `DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md`
2. **Use BUILD-GUIDE.md**: Follow sprint prompts for structured development
3. **Change safety policy**:
   - Prefer minimal-risk changes
   - Preserve current behavior unless intentionally changing it
   - Delete/refactor when there's clear benefit + verification
4. **Explain clearly**: Long explanations with file paths
5. **Use emojis**: Keep energy high! 🤠
6. **Test on device**: AR doesn't work in Unity Editor
7. **Proactive support default**:
   - Assume the user wants maximum hands-on help by default
   - Perform end-to-end diagnosis and implementation whenever safe
8. **Policy source of truth**:
   - Canonical operational policy: `.cursor/rules/proactive-support-defaults.mdc`
   - Use this file for collaboration context, personality preferences, and project intent

### File Path Convention
Always include full paths in code blocks:
```
Assets/Scripts/AR/CoinController.cs
```

## 🤠 The Outlaw Philosophy

> "I've labored long and hard for bread, for honor, and for riches..." — Black Bart

This game is about:
- **Adventure**: Get outside, explore
- **Discovery**: Find hidden treasure
- **Fairness**: Give to receive (hide to unlock higher limits)
- **Fun**: Wild West theme, celebrations
- **Value**: Real rewards

Build it like BB: Bold, adventurous, and with an eye for gold! 💰

*Note: Black Bart was a gentleman stagecoach robber, NOT a pirate. See `brand-guide.md` for details.*
