## Session Notes

### January 17, 2026 - Project Kickoff

**Decision**: Migrate from React Native + ViroReact to Unity + AR Foundation

**Reasons**:
1. ViroReact had critical bugs with React Native 0.81+ (ClassCastException in cleanup)
2. Fabric architecture incompatibility
3. ViroReact's limited community support
4. Need production-quality AR that can scale to millions of users

**Outcome**: Created new repository, setting up Unity environment
