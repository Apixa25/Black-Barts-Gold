- Compass should point accurately to coins

Test by:
1. Placing a test coin at your actual GPS location + 20 meters north
2. Walk toward it
3. Verify distance decreases
4. Verify coin appears in correct direction

## 🤠 Unity-Specific Tips

### Testing AR
- AR doesn't work in Unity Editor - must test on device
- Use Unity Remote for quick preview (limited AR)
- Build and deploy for full AR testing

### Performance
- Profile with Unity Profiler
- Watch draw calls in AR scenes
- Limit active coin count

### Debugging
- Use Debug.Log for tracing
- Unity Console for errors
- ADB logcat for Android logs
